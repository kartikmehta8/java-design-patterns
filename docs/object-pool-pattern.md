# Object Pool Design Pattern

## Overview

The **Object Pool Design Pattern** is a creational design pattern that is used to manage the reuse of expensive-to-create objects. Instead of creating a new object every time it is required, objects are fetched from a pool, which contains a set of initialized objects. If the pool does not contain any available objects, new objects can be created up to a maximum pool size. Once an object is no longer needed, it is returned to the pool for reuse.

## Structure

### 1. **Product (DatabaseConnection)**

The object that will be reused within the pool. In this case, it represents a database connection.

### 2. **Object Pool (ConnectionPool)**

The pool class that manages a set of reusable `DatabaseConnection` objects. It provides a mechanism to acquire and release connections.

### 3. **Client Code**

The client code interacts with the `ConnectionPool` to acquire and release connections without worrying about how the objects are created or managed.

## Usage

### When to Use

- When object creation is **expensive** (in terms of memory, CPU, or other resources) and the same object can be reused.
- When you need to **manage a finite number of resources** like database connections, thread pools, or graphic objects.
- When you need **control over the number of active instances** of a resource to avoid resource depletion.

### Where to Use

- **Database Connections**: Managing and reusing a fixed number of database connections to prevent connection overhead.
- **Thread Pools**: Reusing a limited number of threads to avoid the cost of constantly creating and destroying threads.
- **Object Caching**: Reusing memory-heavy objects that are costly to create (e.g., graphical elements or network resources).

## Advantages

- **Performance Optimization**: Reduces the overhead of object creation by reusing objects instead of creating new ones.
- **Resource Management**: By limiting the number of objects, it prevents resource exhaustion, especially in cases where resources are scarce (e.g., file handles, database connections).
- **Improved Scalability**: Pools provide better scalability, allowing the system to handle more requests without running out of resources.

## Disadvantages

- **Complexity**: Introducing a pool adds complexity to the codebase, particularly when managing thread-safety and synchronization.
- **Management Overhead**: The pool itself needs to be managed carefully, including managing the lifecycle of objects within the pool.
- **Limited Scope**: This pattern is only useful when the objects being managed are expensive to create or need to be reused efficiently.

## Example Usage

Hereâ€™s an example of how the Object Pool pattern can be used:

```java
public class PoolPatternExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ConnectionPool connectionPool = new ConnectionPool(3);  // Max pool size is 3

        DatabaseConnection connection1 = connectionPool.getConnection();
        DatabaseConnection connection2 = connectionPool.getConnection();
        DatabaseConnection connection3 = connectionPool.getConnection();

        // Now all connections are in use, so trying to get another will throw an exception
        try {
            DatabaseConnection connection4 = connectionPool.getConnection();
        } catch (RuntimeException e) {
            System.out.println(e.getMessage());
        }

        // Release a connection and reuse it
        connectionPool.releaseConnection(connection1);
        DatabaseConnection reusedConnection = connectionPool.getConnection();
    }
}
```

## Conclusion

The Object Pool design pattern is an excellent solution for managing expensive-to-create objects that need to be reused. By reusing objects, the system becomes more efficient, avoiding the overhead of constant object creation and destruction. However, it requires careful management, particularly with regards to synchronization and lifecycle management of pooled objects.
